    <h1>Privacy Policy for BudgetMan - Smart Budget Tracker</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: October 2, 2025</em></p>

    <div class="contact-info">
        <h2>1. Identity and Contact Information</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the BudgetMan mobile application ("App") and is managed by the Developer, <strong>Hafiz Muhammad Abdullah</strong> (as listed in the Google Play store). The Developer acts as the data controller for the purposes described below.</p>
        <p>For any privacy inquiries or concerns, please contact the Developer at:</p>
        <p><strong>Developer Contact Email:</strong> contactbudgetman@gmail.com</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Core Data Policy: Zero Collection & Local Storage</h2>
    <p>BudgetMan is designed fundamentally for security and user control. We commit to a policy of <strong>Zero External Data Collection</strong>. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>NO BANK LINKING:</b> The App does not require, request, or connect to any external financial accounts, bank logins, or credit card details.</li>
        <li><b>LOCAL DATA STORAGE:</b> All user-inputted financial data (expenses, income, budgets, categories, and transaction history) is processed and stored **exclusively on the user's local device**.</li>
        <li><b>NO EXTERNAL TRANSMISSION:</b> The Developer **does not upload, sync, or transmit** your sensitive financial data to any external servers, cloud services, or third parties. Your financial life remains entirely private and on-device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Processing and Usage (On-Device Only)</h2>
    <p>The App processes data strictly on your local device to provide core functionality:</p>
    
    <p><b>Data Processed Locally:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Inputted Financial Data:</strong> Transactions, income, custom categories, and financial goals.</li>
        <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> Non-personal technical logs are generated to monitor app stability and performance (e.g., crash reports).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Purpose of Processing:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Core Functionality:</strong> To calculate account balances, generate financial reports, and display spending analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Powered Insights:</strong> The integrated AI system automatically analyzes the **locally stored user data** to generate personalized Smart Alerts and financial suggestions. This processing is performed **entirely on your device** without any data being sent to the Developer.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Third-Party Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not share your private financial information with any third parties for any purpose, including marketing or profiling.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial Data Sharing:</strong> **NONE.** Your expense and income data are not shared, sold, or disclosed externally.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> We may utilize standard, privacy-focused analytical tools (e.g., Google Firebase for crash reporting) to improve app stability. These tools are configured to collect **anonymous, non-personal data only** and are not linked to your financial records.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and User Control (Right to Erasure)</h2>
    <p>You have full, immediate control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Data is retained only for as long as the App remains installed and actively used on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You can **instantly and permanently** delete all of your data by using the "Clear All Data" function within the App's settings, or by simply **uninstalling the App**. Since no server copy exists, the deletion is final upon removal from your device.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>6. Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. If we make any material changes to our data handling practices (for example, if we were to introduce optional server-side syncing), we will notify users clearly through the App or the Google Play Store listing before such changes take effect.</p>
